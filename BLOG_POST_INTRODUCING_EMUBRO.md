# Introducing emuBro: Your Emulator Library, Launcher, and Theme Playground

If you use multiple emulators across multiple platforms, you already know the pain:
different launchers, different configs, scattered ROM folders, missing covers, and zero consistency.

emuBro (yes it's "emuBro" with a lower "e", that's rly important to me) is built to solve that with one desktop app that feels like a modern game hub while still giving power users deep control.

## What emuBro Does

emuBro combines your games, emulators, and tools in one place:

- Unified game library with multiple views: cover, list, table, slideshow, and random.
- Fast category filtering with single-select and multi-select workflows.
- Drag-and-drop import for games and emulator executables.
- Built-in emulator management and per-platform configuration tools.
- Favorites, ratings, playtime tracking, and recent activity.

You can browse quickly, launch directly, and keep your setup organized without jumping between apps.

## Built for Performance

Large collections are handled with lazy loading and chunked rendering so browsing stays smooth.
Game views unload and reload smartly as needed to reduce memory pressure, especially in cover-heavy libraries.

When launching a game session, emuBro can move into a lightweight background mode so more system resources stay available for your emulator.

## Deep Customization

Theme support is a major part of emuBro:

- Built-in default themes plus custom theme creation.
- Dual-font behavior for title/body use cases.
- Advanced color and background controls.
- Logo/brand text effects with custom presets.
- LLM-assisted theme generation with mood/style controls.

You can make emuBro look minimal, retro, neon, dark, light, or fully custom.

## LLM Features Across the App

LLM tools are integrated throughout emuBro, not just in one screen.

- AI-assisted theme generation with mood/style controls and randomized color exploration.
- AI game tagging for single games and global batch tagging.
- AI helper flows in Suggested/library contexts.
- LLM-based language translation workflows in the Language Manager.
- Support-oriented flows that can suggest fixes and structured help steps.

The goal is practical assistance: faster setup, better organization, and fewer repetitive manual tasks.

## Language System That Stays Flexible

emuBro ships lean and can download extra locale packs.

In the Language Manager, users can:

- Install locale packs from the external locale repository.
- Edit translations live in the app.
- Export language JSON.
- Rename user-installed languages.
- Delete user-installed languages.
- Change each language flag icon.

This keeps the main app small while still supporting multilingual setups.

## Tools Included

Beyond launching games, emuBro includes utility views such as:

- Memory card tooling
- BIOS management
- ROM and setup workflows
- Monitor/display tools
- Gamepad testing and mapping helpers

It’s designed as a complete emulator command center, not just a launcher.

## Update Experience

emuBro now supports:

- App updates
- Separate emubro-resources updates
- Manual checks
- Automatic checks on startup
- Interval-based checks with user control

Users get a clear update indicator in the title bar when either app or resources updates are available.

## Final Note

emuBro is focused on practical daily use: fast navigation, low friction setup, strong customization, and power-user controls when you need them.
If your emulator setup has grown into chaos, emuBro is built to bring it back under control.
