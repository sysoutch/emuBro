# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
emuBro-Reloaded addresses the need for a modern, user-friendly interface for retro gaming enthusiasts. Traditional emulator interfaces are often outdated and difficult to navigate, making it challenging for users to discover, organize, and play their retro game collections.

1. Browse and organize their game library
2. Launch games through integrated emulators
3. Customize the interface with themes
4. Switch between multiple languages
5. Access tools and settings for advanced configuration

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive and modern interface design
- Fast and responsive performance
- Easy game discovery and organization
- Seamless emulator integration
- Personalized experience through themes and settings
- Multilingual support for global accessibility
