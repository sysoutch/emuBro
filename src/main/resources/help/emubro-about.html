<p><i>"emuBro is a game launcher that associates your games with your emulators such as snes9x, epsxe, pcsx2, dolphin or whatever you like."</i></p>
<h3 style="color: #000080;">What does it means? I don't understand a word!</h3>
Quite simply, emuBro lists your games and let you organize, manage and of course launch them.<br>
<br>
Maybe you already use other launchers like Steam, Origin, Battle.net or something like that to play your PC games.<br>
emuBro is just that, a game launcher. But it was mainly built to run retro games.<br>
<br>
<u>For example:</u><br>
Games, such as <strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> for the <strong>Sony PlayStation</strong> can be played very well on a computer with <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> or <strong>Mac</strong> on it.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color: #000080;">You are kidding me, right?!"</h3>
No its true! This is called <strong>emulation</strong>. And what do you think you need to <strong>emulate</strong> something? Just right, an <strong>emulator!</strong><br><br>
You will find more information about emulators in the next section <a href="aboutEmulators"><strong>"What is an emulator?"</strong></a>
