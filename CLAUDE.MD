# Project Memory
This project uses a Cline-style Memory Bank located in the `memory-bank/` folder.

## Rules
- Before starting a task, read `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- When you finish a significant task or learn a new pattern, update the relevant files in `memory-bank/`.
- Maintain the state of `memory-bank/progress.md`.
